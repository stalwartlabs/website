# Overview

The management of Stalwart Mail Server can be approached through various methods, each suited to different user preferences and requirements:

At the forefront of these methods is the [web-based admin tool](/docs/management/webadmin/overview), which is the most user-friendly and recommended approach for configuring and managing Stalwart. This tool provides a comprehensive interface for overseeing various aspects of the mail server, making it accessible even for those who may not be as technically inclined.

For users who prefer a more hands-on method or require automation in scripting tasks, Stalwart offers a [command-line interface](/docs/management/cli/overview) (CLI) tool. While this CLI tool allows for significant control over the server's operation and configuration, it's important to note that it doesn't encompass the entire range of functionalities available through the web-based admin tool. This makes the CLI a robust, yet slightly limited, option compared to its web-based counterpart.

Additionally, catering to developers and those integrating Stalwart Mail Server into larger systems or applications, there is a [REST API](/docs/management/api/overview). This API facilitates remote management and configuration of Stalwart through programmable interfaces, allowing for automation and integration within custom applications or management systems. This level of access is particularly beneficial for those who need to embed mail server management capabilities directly into their software solutions, offering a flexible and powerful way to control Stalwart Mail Server programmatically.
