# Compiling Stalwart

Compiling Stalwart from the source has the main advantage that binaries are built with optimizations specific to your hardware which may result in better performance.
Another advantage is that you may enable or disable features to suit your needs, thus reducing the size of the binary and the memory footprint.

## Install Rust

To compile Stalwart you need the latest version of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). The fastest way to install rust is with ``rustup``. On Unix systems run the following in your terminal, then follow the onscreen instructions

```bash
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

If you are running Windows 64-bit, download and run [rustupâ€‘init.exe](https://rustup.rs), then follow the onscreen instructions. 

## Clone the repository

Clone the Stalwart repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/stalwartlabs/stalwart.git
$ cd stalwart
```

Find and then check out the latest tagged release, for example:

```bash
$ git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -1
v0.13.0
$ git checkout tags/v0.13.0
```

:::tip Note

Never compile Stalwart from the `main` branch, as it may contain unstable code. Always use a tagged release.

:::


## Install any required dependencies

If you are compiling the Foundation DB backend, download and install the [Foundation DB client library](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/releases).

## Compile

For example, to compile Stalwart with the RocksDB, ElasticSearch support and Enterprise [features](#available-features):

```bash
$ cargo build --release -p stalwart --no-default-features --features "rocks elastic redis enterprise"
```

Or, to compile the FoundationDB backend:

```bash
$ cargo build --release -p stalwart  --no-default-features --features "foundationdb enterprise"
```

:::tip Grab a cup of coffee

Rust is a powerful language, but it can take some time to compile large projects like Stalwart, especially with multiple features enabled. Be patient!

:::

Once the compilation process is completed, the Stalwart binary will be available under ``target/release/stalwart``.
